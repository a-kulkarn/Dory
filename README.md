=== Dory.jl ===

Package to extend the functionality of Nemo/Hecke. Notable additions include:

Basic utilities
-- Allows Julia broadcasting for AbstractAlgebra matrices.
-- Convenient constructors for AbstractAlgebra matrices.
-- Indexing functions for AbstractAlgebra matrices.

padic linear algebra:
-- padic qr-factorization.
-- padic singular value decomposition.
-- padically stable solving of linear systems.
-- padically stable hessenburg form.
-- eigenvector solver (power and inverse iterations). [Only implemented for matrices defined over Qp]
-- block schur form. [Only implemented for matrices defined over Qp]
